# C Projects

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of C programming projects I worked on during my first semester of college. These were my first real steps into the world of coding, and they hold a special place in my journey as a developer.

## About the Projects

Each project here was part of my coursework or personal practice while learning the fundamentals of programming in C. From simple console applications to slightly more complex logic problems, these projects helped me understand the core concepts like:
- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements
- Loops and iteration
- Functions
- Arrays and pointers
- Basic file I/O

## About this Repo

This repo is both a showcase and a time capsule â€” a reminder of how much fun it was to solve problems for the first time and how satisfying it felt to see code run successfully (after many failed attempts). It's also a great point of reference for anyone just starting out with C or looking to reflect on their own progress.
